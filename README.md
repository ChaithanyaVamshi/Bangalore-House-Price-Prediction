# Bangalore-House-Price-Prediction

This project walks through step by step process of how to build and predict the house prices in Bangalore. We will first build a model using sklearn and linear regression using banglore home prices dataset from kaggle. During model building we will cover almost all  concepts such as data loading and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tunning, k fold cross validation etc. Also, used algorithms like Linear Regression, Decision tree, Lasso Regression to check  best accuracy.

Below are the tools and technolgies used:

1. Python
2. Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
3. Matplotlib for data visualization
4. Sklearn for model building
5. Jupyter notebook
